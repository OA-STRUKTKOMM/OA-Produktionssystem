README OA-Satzsystem
-----------

OA-Satzsystem is open source software that works across platforms 
as an out-of-the-box solution. With this application, university publishers 
and libraries can generate all common output formats at the push of a button 
based on the input format (XML in BITS structure) without any specific 
knowledge. The system works with standardized templates. By adapting 
configuration files, design specifications can also be stored. A detailed 
description of how to use the system can be found in the manual.
